GPGServices
Version: 1.7a2

GPGServices is a plugin for the global OS X Services menu, which adds the ability to almost any application (e.g. Safari, Finder, or TextEdit) to use OpenPGP functionalities. In a nutshell:

* Any folder: sign and encrypt.
* Any file: verify, sign, import, encrypt, and decrypt.
* Any text selection: verify and import.
* Any text field: verify, sign, import, export, encrypt, and decrypt.

IMPORTANT: You might have to enable the menu items at System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Services > Text > ...
