GPGServices 1.10b1 - Release Notes
========================================

Features
--------
### Clearly indicate which keys are selected
* Below the key list you'll now find an indicator showing if any keys are selected. Any keys already selected will always show on the top of the key list, so you will not accidentally encrypt to the wrong recpipient. If you want to unselect all keys we now provide a simple checkbox for that. [#183]
